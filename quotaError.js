The Firebase Realtime Database sometimes throws a `QuotaExceededError` even when the data size is well below the quota limits. This usually happens due to an unexpected increase in the number of connections or write operations within a short period, leading to temporary exceeding of the rate limits. This error is not explicitly handled in the Firebase documentation, causing unexpected application behavior.
